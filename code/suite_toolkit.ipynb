    "This Jupyter notebook implements some tools to conduct \"hybrid\" stratified risk-limiting audits as described in Risk-Limiting Audits by Stratified Union-Intersection Tests of Elections (SUITE), by Ottoboni, Stark, Lindeman, and McBurnett.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an implementation of tools for \"comparison\" risk-limiting audits as described in AGI, see http://statistics.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/auditTools.htm. For the sister ballot polling tool, see https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~stark/Vote/ballotPollTools.htm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools on this page help perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose a number of ballots to audit in each stratum initially, on the assumption that the contest outcome is correct.\n",
    "* Select random samples of ballots in each stratum.\n",
    "* Find those ballots using ballot manifests.\n",
    "* Determine whether the audit can stop, given the votes on the ballots in the sample. \n",
    "* If the audit cannot stop yet, estimate how many additional ballots will need to be audited.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is already filled out with an example election. It can be run from start to finish to demonstrate how the tool works. The numbers in the example can be deleted and replaced with actual data for an audit."

    "We leave [a comprehensive introduction to the Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) to the experts, but below are a few features you should know to use this tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "* notebooks are comprised of _cells_, blocks of code that can be run together. To the left of a code cell, you will see either [] (indicating that it has not been run yet) or [x] (where x is a number indicating that it was the xth cell to be run). You can the code in a cell by clicking into the cell, indicated by a green box around the cell, and running `Ctrl + Enter`.\n",
    "* code lines that begin with `#` are comments. They're not actually run, but are there to describe what the code is doing.\n",
    "* the text in a notebook is also written in a cell. Instead of a code cell, it's a Markdown cell. Clicking on a text cell will make it editable; running `Ctrl + Enter` will render it back into text.\n",
    "* the order in which cells are executed matters. Code in later cells depends on earlier cells. However, it is _possible_ to run cells out of order or rerun cells that have been run earlier; this can cause problem. In general, it is __best practice__ to rerun the entire notebook after you have filled in the values you want. To do so, click on the `Kernel` menu at the top of the page and select `Restart & Run All`. This will clear the memory and rerun everything in the prescribed order.\n",
