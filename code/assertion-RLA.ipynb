    "Tool to audit generalized assertions about contests, including assertions for RLAs of IRV contests.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool can audit any number of contests simultaneously using the same sample.\n",
    "The contests can be audited to different risk limits.\n",
    "The contests can have different social choice functions, including majority or super-majority,\n",
    "plurality, multi-winner plurality, and IRV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit is \"simultaneous\" across contests in the following sense: \n",
    "\n",
    ">If the reported outcome of a contest is incorrect, the chance that the audit stops without a full hand count is at most the risk limit for that contest. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample is drawn as a random sample of individual ballots, with or without replacement, from a single pool of all ballots cast in the contest(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach taken here uses a new abstract framing of RLAs.\n",
    "It involves constructing a set of _assertions_ about each contest. The assertions are predicates on the set of votes, that is, they are either true or false, depending on what votes the whole set of ballots shows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each assertion is characterized by an _assorter_.  An assorter assigns a nonnegative number to each ballot, depending on what votes the ballot shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a two-candidate plurality contest in which Alice was reported to have beaten Bob, an assorter might assign the value 1 to a ballot if the ballot has a vote for Alice and the value 0 to a ballot if it has a vote for Bob.\n",
    "If every ballot has a vote either for Alice or for Bob, Alice beat Bob iff the average value of the assorter applied to all the ballots is greater than 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there are undervotes, overvotes, or invalid ballots--or votes for other candidates? Let the assorter assign the value 1/2 to such ballots. Then it is still the case that Alice got more votes than Bob iff the average value of the assorter applied to all the ballots is greater than 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-winner plurality\n",
    "\n",
    "The reported winner(s) of a (multi-winner) plurality contest really won if every reported winner got more votes than every reported loser.\n",
    "If we construct (#winners)x(#losers) assorters, one for each (winner, loser) pair, then the reported outcome is correct if the average each of assorter applied to the ballots is greater than 1/2.\n",
    "This is essentially the approach taken in Stark (20??) to reduce auditing multi-winner contests to auditing a set of two-candidate contests.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### IRV\n",
    "\n",
    "Blom et al. (2018) show how to reduce the correctness of a reported IRV winner to the correctness of the reported winners of a set of two-\"generalized candidate\" contests\n",
    "The \"generalized candidates\" in those contests are not necessarily the candidates in the original contest; they are just two mutually exclusive (but not exhaustive) conditions that a ballot might satisfy.\n",
    "If the set of cast ballots has more ballots that satisfy the first condition than the second, the assertion is true.\n",
    "Thus if we define an assorter to assign 1 to ballots that satisfy the first condition, 0\n",
    "to ballots that satisfy the second condition, and 1/2 to ballots that satisfy neither,\n",
    "the assertion is true iff the average of the assorter over the collection of cast ballots\n",
    "is greater than 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Super-majority\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a candidate must get at least a fraction $f \\in [1/2, 1)$ of the valid votes\n",
    "to win. Stark (20??) shows how to audit this social choice function, but it can also be expressed in terms of an assertion that the average of an assorter applied to the cast ballots is greater than 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice really won a super-majority contest with required winning fraction $f$ iff\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{(votes for Alice)} > f \\times \\left ( \\mbox{(votes for Alice)} + \\mbox{(votes for everyone else)} \\right )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  (1-f) \\times \\mbox{(votes for Alice)} > f \\times \\mbox{(votes for everyone else)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1-f}{f} \\times \\mbox{(votes for Alice)} > \\mbox{(votes for everyone else)}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Define an assorter as follows: it assigns the value $1/(2f)$ to a ballot if it contains\n",
    "a vote for Alice, the value 0 if the ballot contains a valid vote for any other candidate\n",
    "in the contest, and the value 1/2 if the ballot does not have a valid vote.\n",
    "Suppose that a fraction $p > f$ of the valid votes are for Alice, and that a fraction $q$ of\n",
    "the ballots have valid votes.\n",
    "Then the average of this assorter over the ballots is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "pq/(2f) + (1-q)/2 \\ge 2/2 + (1-q)/2 = 1/2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, using assorters reduces auditing to the question of whether the average of a list of non-negative\n",
    "numbers is greater than 1/2.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Assertion audits\n",
    "\n",
    "A contest is audited to risk limit $\\alpha$ if the negation of each assertion about the \n",
    "contest can be rejected at significance level $\\alpha$.\n",
    "The audit of a contest continues until all the assertions about it have been established,\n",
    "or until there has been a full manual tally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The audit stops short of a full tally only if all the assertions are confirmed.\n",
    "The chance of confirming any assertion that is false is at most $\\alpha$, so if there\n",
    "are one or more false assertions (i.e., if the reported outcome is incorrect), \n",
    "the chance that the audit continues to a full hand\n",
    "count is at least $1-\\alpha$ (and possibly larger).\n",
    "\n",
    "We directly test whether the complement of an assertion is false by testing the hypothesis that the average of the assorter applied to the cast ballots is less than or equal to 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ballot-polling assertion audits\n",
    "\n",
    "These are immediate. Each assertion can be tested by testing the hypothesis\n",
    "that the average of the assertion over the cast ballots is less than or equal to 1/2,\n",
    "for instance, using Wald's SPRT (as in BRAVO and Gentle Introduction), or some other method.\n",
